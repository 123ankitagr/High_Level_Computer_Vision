# High_Level_Computer_Vision

## Assignment 1:

In this exercise you will first familiarise yourself with basic image filtering routines. In the second part, you will develop a simple image querying system which accepts a query image as input and then finds a set of similar images in the database. In order to compare images you will implement some simple histogram based distance functions and evaluate their performance in combination with different image representations.
